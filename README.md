# :eyes: Simulating Human Vision using MATLAB

:white_check_mark: Project from an undergraduate course, **"Information Processing Theory"** (COG4101.01-00) at Yonsei university

:calendar: **Fall, 2022**

## Purpose of this Project
This project follows how raw image information is processed, starting from the level of **pupil** to **V1 area**. 


## Theoretical Background

### World to Retina
Light from the source (sun, light bulb etc...) hits an object and then bounces off. That precise moment is when the light contains the information of the object. Depending on the substance and surface of the object, some range of the light does not bounce off. The bounced light reaches our pupil and that is when our vision system start its process.

Some might say, how come the pupil is the start of the process. It is because the biological lens of the pupil modifies the input light. 




### Retina to LGN 
LGN(Lateral geniculate nucleus)

### LGN to V1
